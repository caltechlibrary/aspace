## Action Item

### Bugs

+ Need to strip unneeded characters from input to prevent XSS attacks (or figure out how to use html/template and still get highlight)
+ Need a better title sort (e.g. remove stop words)
+ Missing timing info to log output of genpages, and indexpages

# some day maybe list

+ js.go include polyfils for JS functions and methods describe at MDN's JavaScript section
+ template.go should have the functions that Hugo has to make the templates interoperable
