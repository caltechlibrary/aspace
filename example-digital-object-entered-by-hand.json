Clauser, Clark B. Millikan Professor of Engineering, emeritus, and chairman of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science from 1969 to 1974. He recalls his arrival at Caltech in 1969 to head the engineering division; discusses the broadening of Caltech’s engineering option during the 1960s, including a shift toward fundamental research and an increase in the size of the faculty and the graduate program, enabled in part by a generous Ford Foundation grant. Comments on the current state of the division, with numerous retirements coming up and the opportunity for new hires. Recalls the establishment of the Environmental Quality Laboratory and the applied physics option. Discusses the development of computer science at Caltech and his efforts to build up communications science by recruiting John Pierce from Bell Labs. Comments on Caltech’s contributions to earthquake engineering. He concludes the interview by discussing his initiation of the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholars Program."],"jsonmodel_type":"note_digital_object","label":"Abstract","persistent_id":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechOH:OH_Clauser_F","publish":true,"type":"note"}],"user_defined":null,"linked_instances":[]}
